## Business Intelligence Data Challenge 2022

Instructions

The Fintech Cashfirst is in a stage of validating its first months of operation in the market, which is why it turns to you, as an expert in business intelligence and BI (among the audience interested in this information are marketing, finance, operations, and analytics areas).

Data:

Below you will find two datasets exported in xlsx format (Clientes_pruebabi: demographic information of clients / Transaccionalidad_pruebabi: transactions made by clients). These datasets will allow you to carry out the activity, so it is necessary to study and analyze their content before use.

Analysis:

Once you have reviewed the attached data, it is necessary to answer the questions that are divided into three types:

General business questions (key metrics for the strategy of the aforementioned Fintech)
Specific Questions (The analytics unit is interested in knowing specific indicators)
Capture the scenario: present key questions to the audience that can be solved with your findings. Remember that you can generate ranges or classify the data individually.

Basic business questions:
Q Clients
Average Customer Age
Gender Participation
Total Transactions (Quantity, Total Amount, Average Amount)

Specific Questions:

Considering that the clients' base contains the total, please expose the MAU (Monthly Active Users) of the last 3 months of the data.
What are the possible relationships between the most transactional and least transactional users with the demographic variables of both datasets?
Capture the scenario:
Based on the data provided, the company wants to know an open analysis from your side, in which you expose your findings, hypotheses, and conclusions. Recommendations are a key factor in understanding the objective of the analysis.

Deliverable:
It must be a dashboard in the tool of your preference with the information answering the questions posed. Once the case is submitted, we will contact you to coordinate a 15-minute session where you can defend said deliverable.
